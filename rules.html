<h1>Horse race v 0.5</h1>
Rules:<br><br>
At the beginning you have $<script type='text/javascript'>document.write(money);</script>. You can spend $<script type='text/javascript'>document.write(betCost);</script> to bet them on one of four horses.<br>
Then the race begins! In case your horse will win, you save your money and gain additional $<script type='text/javascript'>document.write(betCost);</script>.<br>
But if your horse won't win the race, you lose your $<script type='text/javascript'>document.write(betCost);</script>. Gain $100 to win the game! <br>
So what are you waiting for? Let's try your luck!
